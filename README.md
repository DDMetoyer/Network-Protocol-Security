# 🌐 Network Protocol Security

Welcome to the Network Protocol Security repository! This repository contains detailed analysis and research on vulnerabilities, exploitation methods, and defense strategies related to various network protocols across the TCP/IP stack.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand network protocol vulnerabilities and attack methodologies.
- Analyze and mitigate protocol-specific threats such as session hijacking, ARP spoofing, DNS poisoning, and VLAN hopping.
- Explore techniques to secure networks through protocol-level defenses and configuration best practices.

## 🛠️ Topics Covered
